# Red Badge Project: Iâ€™d Tap That
## General Info

For the Red Badge Individual Project the goal was to create a .NET Framework MVC 5 Web Application using n-tier architecture covering a topic of your choice.

I chose to create an app titled I'd Tap That. It is a beer drinker's database. A place to store reviews of beers from different breweries all over the world. This gives users a guide to what they liked and didnt like, so they can make more informed choices when ordering beer in the future!
